**Introducing CareTopicz**

We built an AI agent that runs inside OpenEMR so clinicians can ask natural-language questions and get tool-backed answers—drug interactions, symptom lookup, provider search, appointments, insurance—without leaving the EHR.

What matters to us:
- **Verification layer:** Every response is checked; the agent never diagnoses or prescribes.
- **Eval suite:** 61 test cases (correctness, edge cases, adversarial, multi-step) with an 80% pass gate in CI.
- **OpenEMR integration:** Drop-in module + Python agent service; you can run it yourself.

If you’re working on healthcare AI or OpenEMR, we’d love your feedback. Code and docs: [repo link]
